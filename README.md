# work-better

Sometimes boring solutions are the best.

This is just basic website that I hope will make sure I focus on my work more.

#### Things I'm planning to have

[] A timer

[] Links to a few good bits of background noise

[] Few useful lines to remind me to focus

[] A few basic tracking things on the site

#### Questions

Will it work? Probably not.

What's the point? Takes minimal time to set up, easy to improve.

#### Tech

HTML, CSS, JS

CSS is in utility style following [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) conventions.
