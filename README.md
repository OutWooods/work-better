#### Things I'm planning to have

see [features](features.md) for more plans

[x] A timer

[x] Links to a few good bits of background noise

[x] Few useful lines to remind me to focus

[] A few basic tracking things on the site

#### Questions

Will it work? Probably not.

What's the point? Takes minimal time to set up, easy to improve. Also starting out (at least) in vanilla JS is a good reminder of the skills I need. But also, a point to reflect on why frameworks liek React or Vue are useful/not.

#### Tech

HTML, CSS, JS

CSS is in utility style following [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) conventions.

#### Running locally

1. Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

3. Go to the URL it suggests

4. Done!
