[x] A timer

[x] Links to a few good bits of background noise

[x] Few useful lines to remind me to focus

[] A few basic tracking things on the site

#### Questions

Will it work? Probably not.

What's the point? Takes minimal time to set up, easy to improve. Also starting out (at least) in vanilla JS is a good reminder of the skills I need. But also, a point to reflect on why frameworks liek React or Vue are useful/not.

#### Tech

HTML, CSS, JS

CSS is in utility style following [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) conventions.
