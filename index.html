    <h1>Use time well</h1>
    <h2>A few tips on this site. Take or leave as you wish</h2>
    <p>
        Trust the timer. Ideally avoid looking back on it. If you need to. Pay attention as you click. You'll see a
        RUNNING message on the tab. The reason for this is that the more time you think and check the time, the more
        you're breaking from the task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Avoid music (except the lofi below) unless it's the only way to get you to work.
        Music is distracting, making decisions about it is distracting. But sometimes you do need something to ramp you
        up. There are three tracks, but working in silence is surprisingly pleasant if you can.
    </p>
    <p>
        With tracking. Be honest, and be slightly pedantic. Aka, the distraction counter might miss something or you
        might waste the last minute before the timer. If there's something you don't quite know if you should count it
        as a distraction.Count it. If you think you missed out a counter, add it. It's better to be slightly pedantic on
        the rules rather than allowing grey areas, because it stops you cheating them in the long run. There's no
        reward/punishment for these, so there's no real value to cheating.

        <h2>Reviews of the three noises I've chosen</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://coffitivity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffivity</a>
            Coffinity - sound of cafe, more loud. Very effective if you're working in a noisey place, as it makes
            everything blur. Also if you're working alone, makes you feel a bit less isolated.
            Very occasionally distracting. My more extroverted work music.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.noisli.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nosili</a>
            Noisli - Mix and match sounds from the site. Also has a timer too. Need an account to access,
            and can be a bit distracting to find the perfect mix of sounds. More if you want to get some space and
            feel
            a bit more alone. My more introverted work music.
            Top combo - rain, thunder and brown noise.
        </p>

                hop
                mix</a>
            Lofi hip hop mix - nice, main risk is this is a youtube video and the video is a bit distracting. But is
            nice and relaxing to work to. 2 hours of music.
            Makes you feel like you're in one of the panoramic shots by Johnny Harris for Vox.
