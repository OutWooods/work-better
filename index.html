        <h2>A few tips on this site. Take or leave as you wish</h2>
        <p>
            Trust the timer. Ideally avoid looking back on it. Pay attention as you click. You'll see a
            RUNNING message on the tab, that way you know you did start - but you dont know time remaining.
            The reason for this, is knowing how long left changes my focus. But also looking at the time is breaking
            from the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also tracks your distractions. Every time you focus on the tab during the timer, it counts as a
            distraction.
            So if you want, you can use this as a proxy measure. So for example, every time I look at facebook, I tab
            into this page to
            'log' a distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally I avoided music, but now I do. I find I enjoy my work more, if I need to focus I use one of the
            three links
            at the bottom. Especially heavy mental work. My rule is never change my spotify playlist in a work cycle.
            And if I do, I count
            that as a distraction. At times working in silence is surprisingly pleasant if you can.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a cycle is complete, you'll here a small ding. I've kept it unintrusive. But it's amazing how good you
            get
            at picking it out. I wanted something pleasant, nice but also which will let you keep going if you want.
            Just click the extend button if you continue working and it'll log that cycle as extra long.
        </p>
        <p>
            With tracking. Be honest, and be slightly pedantic. Aka, the distraction counter might miss something or you
            might waste the last minute before the timer. If there's something you don't quite know if you should count
            it
            as a distraction.Count it. If you think you missed out a counter, add it. It's better to be slightly
            pedantic on
            the rules rather than allowing grey areas, because it stops you cheating them in the long run.
            For me personally, I don't do any rewards or punishments based on this. It's just a factual record of my
            work.
            No judgement, just guidence, and a record to help me see how I am working and how I could improve.
            This way, there's no incentive to cheat. But also, it's easier to keep up, as it's not a source of shame.

        <h2>Reviews of the three noises I've chosen</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://coffitivity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffivity</a>
            Coffinity - sound of cafe, more loud. Very effective if you're working in a noisey place, as it makes
            everything blur. Also if you're working alone, makes you feel a bit less isolated.
            Very occasionally distracting. My more extroverted work music.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.noisli.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nosili</a>
            Noisli - Mix and match sounds from the site. Also has a timer too. Need an account to access,
            and can be a bit distracting to find the perfect mix of sounds. More if you want to get some space and
            feel
            a bit more alone. My more introverted work music.
            Top combo - rain, thunder and brown noise.
        </p>

                hop
                mix</a>
            Lofi hip hop mix - nice, main risk is this is a youtube video and the video is a bit distracting. But is
            nice and relaxing to work to. 2 hours of music.
            Makes you feel like you're in one of the panoramic shots by Johnny Harris for Vox.
