## Completed

- Can time for 30 minutes

- Can stop timer

- Add links to three good work sounds

- Sound goes off when the 30 minutes is done

- Page title changes when time is running or complete

- Can log different 'focus areas' <- want a better name. With increase/decrease counts

- Have a 'current focus'. Which auto increments if you finish the timer

- Have a log for the day of completed cycles (Task, Time, start and end, check count). Maybe optional logger of things.

## In progress

[x] Bug - show current focus as it's going

[ ] Store helper methods in utlities

## Planned

- Design

- Can adjust time

- Can pause time

- Make the advice/comments hideable (maybe in the corner, a 'clear view' options)

- The head tab says which task and count

- Can hide all the comments/advice.

- Add a nice footer

- Make focus optional

- Store log in localStorage.

- Show date on task if it's not today.

- clear local storage.

- Track every time during the timer you come and check the page.

- Can clear data.

- Add tests for the helper methods

- Stop logs incomplete activities

## Mulling over

- Can type in goal at top

- Second, slightly louder sound if not noticed a minute later

- Better name for focus areas (dont want to use the word task - might go with jobs)

- Have a blank style and a nice style. Toggle CSS sheets.

- Can easily copy over the data for the day.

## Technical work

- Maybe porting it out to Vue (for say V2)

- Add some backend to store values

- Some sort of change log for features

- Move to typescript (for V2)

- Make a store to edit values

## Bugs

- Ding isnt working (PRIORITY)
