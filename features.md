## Completed

- Can time for 30 minutes

- Can stop timer

- Add links to three good work sounds

- Sound goes off when the 30 minutes is done

- Page title changes when time is running or complete

- Can log different 'focus areas' <- want a better name. With increase/decrease counts

## Planned

- Style it a bit more presentably

- Can adjust time

- Can pause time

## Considering

- Can type in goal at top

- Some sort of change log

- Second, slightly louder sound if not noticed a minute later

- Better name for focus areas
